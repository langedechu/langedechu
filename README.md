Hello world! My name is Paul.

I'm currently a **high school student** and passionnate about **software development**.

I started programming when I was **10 years old** and I've been doing it ever since.

**Python** was my first language but I quickly switched on **web developement** with **NodeJS**.

I couldn't find any langage as good as NodeJS so I'm still learning from it.
